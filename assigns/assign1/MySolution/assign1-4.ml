Given two strings ds1 and ds2 of digits, please
implement intrep_add(ds1)(ds2) that returns the
string representing the sum of the two integers
represented by ds1 and ds2. Note that the returned
string should contain no leading zeros. (And we
use the empty string to represent the number zero).

fun intrep(ds1: int)(ds2: int): int					     

For instance, "6123" + "987" = "7110"

Note that ds1 and ds2 can be arbitrarily long. Thus,
converting ds1 and ds2 to integers can cause overflow.
