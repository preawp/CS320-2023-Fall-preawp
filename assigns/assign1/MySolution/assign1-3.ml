A 3-letter sequence abc is 132-like
if a < c < b holds. For instance, 123 is
not 132-like; but 596 is 132-like.

A string is 132-avoid if there is no subsequence
abc in this string that is 132-like. Note that a
subsequence of a string may contain NON-CONSEQUTIVE
letters of the string.

For instance, 123456789 is 132-avoid;
For instance, 987654321 is 132-avoid;
For instance, 123465789 is not 132-avoid since the
subsequence 165 is 132-like.

Please implement a function string_avoid_132 that
check if a given string is 132-avoid; the function
returns true if and only if the given string is 132-
avoid.

fun string_avoid_132(cs: string): bool
