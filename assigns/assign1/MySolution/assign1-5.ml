A sequence of chars is ascending if any char in
the sequence is less than or equal to the following
one (when the following one does exist).
Given a string cs, please implement a function
that find the longest ascending subsequence of [cs].
If there are more than one such sequences, the left
most one should be returned.

fun string_longest_ascend(xs: string): string

For instance, given "1324561111", the function
string_longest_ascend returns "13456"

For instance, given "1234561111", the function
string_longest_ascend returns "123456"

For instance, given "1234511111", the function
string_longest_ascend returns "111111".
